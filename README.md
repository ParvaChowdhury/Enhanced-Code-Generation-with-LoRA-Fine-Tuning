# Enhanced-Code-Generation-with-LoRA-Fine-Tuning
Fine-tuned the Gemma 2B IT model using Hugging Face libraries and LoRA, focusing on improving code generation capabilities. Leveraged a dataset containing pre-trained functions and employed advanced parameters such as QLoRA and bitsandbytes for optimization. The fine-tuned model produced significantly improved code outputs.
